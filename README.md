So this is my first CNN! 

LN[1] We just get the packages we need to actually make the CNN. We also get numpy and sklearn model selection to split the data for the model we will be making 

Summary:
LN[2] We split the data into 3 parts TRAIN which is 70% and test/validation data which is 15% each 

Overview of what the code is:
The first line in this we get the data into var. The 2nd/3rd line of code I concatenate the data into X and Y variables(x - independent var Y - dependent what is the outcome?)
Then in line 4 of the code I split the training data with a temp variable 70:30 
Then in line 5 I split the 30% between 2 variables -test/validation- evenly 15% each.
